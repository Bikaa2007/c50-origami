        <h2><i>Facts About Chameleons</i></h2>
        <p>Chameleons are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species.
            These species come in a range of colors, and many species have the ability to change color.
            Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their very extensive, not highly modified, 
            rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout. </p>

        <h3><i>Facts About Pigeons</i></h3>
        <p>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. 
            They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.
             They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.
            Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.
             A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, 
             even changing direction at junctions. Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.

         <h4><i>Facts About Panda</i></h4>
         <p>The giant panda  also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bearnative to south central China.
              It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body.
              The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.
